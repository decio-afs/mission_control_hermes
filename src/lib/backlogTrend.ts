// backlogTrend — pure, client-side queue-health aggregation.
//
// Run #11's throughput view answers "how many tasks finished each hour" (a raw
// per-hour histogram). This answers the *operational* question one level up: is
// the queue keeping up, or falling behind? It folds the already-polled Mc
// task list (`useTaskStore.mcTasks`) into a trailing window and accumulates
// arrivals (created) and completions (done) into two cumulative series — the gap
// between them is the net backlog the window added or burned down. Plus the live,
// window-independent count of still-open work (instantaneous WIP). No new bridge
// endpoint: a pure fold over the queue, same source as the leaderboard/throughput.

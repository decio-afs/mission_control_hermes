// agingWip — pure, client-side aging analysis of still-open work.
//
// Run #16 (cycleTime) measures how long *finished* work took. This is its dual:
// how long *unfinished* work has been sitting. It selects every still-open task
// (anything not in a terminal state) and buckets each by its age —
//   now − (started_at ?? created_at)
// — into the SAME human duration bands as the cycle-time histogram (imported
// from cycleTime, not re-declared), so an operator can spot tasks silently
// rotting in the queue at a glance and jump straight to the oldest offenders.
// No bridge endpoint: a pure fold over the already-polled task store.

// A task is "open" (work-in-progress) unless it has reached a terminal state.
// Mirrors the closed-set used by computeBacklogTrend's openBacklog so the two
// queue views agree on what counts as still-in-flight.
